## Getting Started

Please consult Gelati Sugarfree's [Quick Setup Guide](https://gelati.sugar3.io/p/docs.html#quick_installation) regarding <i>Installation</i>, <i>Configuration</i> and <i>Customization</i> before Importing one of the available [Blog-Themes](blog-theme).

## Features and Usage
* Although optional, you might consider to import the provided [Demo-Content](demo-content) which provides representational examples regarding Gelati Sugarfree's [Features and Usage](https://gelati.sugar3.io/p/about.html).
* Feel free to delete or unplublish unnecessary Posts, Pages and Labels after you got a grasp on its internals and mechanics.

### Demo-Content Preperation
* For a correct functionality of NumberedPagination: Some of the provided Demo-Content Posts contain <i>Jump-Break</i> directives, an optional feature Blogger/Blogpost utilizes to - among other non-performance related usecases - ease performance impacts when generating IndexType Blog-Views with Post-content exceeding a certain amount of textual data. 
> The Blogger/Blogpost Post-Editor allows to insert a <i>Jump-Break</i> directive which will be represented by the following inline-expression: <pre><i>&lt;!--more--&gt;</i></pre> 
> Unfortunately, whenever exporting content in Blogger/Blogspot these expressions get converted to plain &lt;a&gt;-Tags: <pre><i>&lt;a name='more'&gt;</i> resp. <i>&amp;lt;a name='more'&amp;gt;</i></pre>
> So, afterwards after you have imported such content in Blogger/Blogspot you have to manual replace all occurences of "ill-converted" <i>Jump-Breaks</i> to their correct inline-expression with the help of Post-Editor.

* For a correct presentation of the PopularPosts widget your current published Posts need to have a certain amount of views. Especially in case of starting from scratch, please do ensure you have actually viewed at least <i>numItemsToShow</i> of your favorite Posts a certain amount of times to generate actual views.

## Final Notes

As stated in Gelati Sugarfree's [Advanced Setup Guide](https://gelati.sugar3.io/p/docs.html#advanced_setup)
* For use-cases, including <i>custom domain usage</i>, you are good to go, even when using <i>hosted Assets</i> as referenced in the provided Blog-Themes.
* If you want to <i>self-host</i> these static assets feel free to <i>download</i> [Blog-Resources](blog-resources), provided pre-built here on GitHub.

If you followed these steps and everything worked well you might already have a working instance of Gelati Sugarfree ðŸŽ‰.
